Network Protocols make it possible for any networked computers to talk to each other

## Networking Models
1. TCP/IP Model
2. OSI Model

## Networking Protocols
1.  **Internet Protocol**: It is the key protocol that alllows computers in different physical networks to communicate with each other.
2. **Transpost Control Protocol** (*TCP*); It works by first establishign a connection between the **client** and **server**, and then transferring data. It builds on IP to add guarantees that data messagfes are delivered reliably and , in order.
3. **User Datagram Protocol** (*UDP*): It works at the same layer as TCP, but has no guarantees about data delivery or ordering, So if the application needs faster data transfer and doesn't require a confirmed connection we can use UDP.
4. **Hypertext Transfer Protocol** (*HTTP*): It allows applications to view and modify data over the network.
