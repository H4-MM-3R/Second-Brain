## Local Area Network 
![[Terminology#^d5871b]]
LAN is used for PC's / **workstations** can share data, tools, and programs. 
- The group of devices are connected together by a **switch,** or *stack of switches*, using a private addressing scheme as defined by the **TCP/IP**  [[Terminology#^d1643f|protocol]]. 
- **Private addresses** are unique in relation to other computers on the local network.
- **Routers** are found at the boundary of a *LAN*, connecting them to the larger **WAN**.
- Data transmits at a very fast rate as the number of computers linked is limited.
- A Communication medium used for *LAN* has **twisted-pair cables** and **coaxial cables**.
- A LAN typically relies **mostly on wired connections** for increased speed and security, but **wireless connections can also** be part of a *LAN.*

### Advantages:

- Provides fast data transfer rates and high-speed communication.
- Easy to set up and manage.
- Can be used to share peripheral devices such as printers and scanners.
- Provides increased security and fault tolerance compared to WANs.

### Disadvantages:

- Limited geographical coverage.
- Limited scalability and may require significant infrastructure upgrades to accommodate growth.
- May experience congestion and network performance issues with increased usage.
## Metropolitian Area Network 
![[Terminology#^3390f6]]
- It connects two or more computers that are apart but reside in the same or different cities.
- It covers a large geographical area and may serve as **ISP**(*Internet Service Provider*).
- MAN is designed for customers who need *high-speed connectivity*.
- Itâ€™s hard to design and maintain a MAN.
- Devices used for transmission of data through MAN are **Modem** and **Wire/Cable.**

### Advantages:
- Provides high-speed connectivity over a larger geographical area than *LAN.*
- Can be used as an ISP for multiple customers.
- Offers higher data transfer rates than **WAN** in some cases.
### Disadvantages:
- Can be expensive to set up and maintain.
- May experience congestion and network performance issues with increased usage.
- May have limited fault tolerance and security compared to *LANs.*
## Wide Area Network 
![[Terminology#^75f715]]

-  A WAN could be a connection of LAN connecting to other LANs via telephone lines and radio waves and may be limited to an enterprise (a corporation or an organization) or accessible to the public.
- The technology is high-speed and relatively expensive.
- WAN is difficult to design and maintain.
- A Communication medium used for WAN is PSTN or Satellite Link.
- Due to long-distance transmission, the noise and error tend to be more in WAN.

-  Devices used for the transmission of data through WAN are Optic wires, Microwaves, and Satellites.

### Advantages:
- Covers large geographical areas and can connect remote locations.
- Provides connectivity to the internet.
- Offers remote access to resources and applications.
- Can be used to support multiple users and applications simultaneously.
### Disadvantages:
- Can be expensive to set up and maintain.
- Offers slower data transfer rates than LAN or MAN.
- May experience higher latency and longer propagation delays due to longer distances and multiple network hops.
- May have lower fault tolerance and security compared to LANs.


> [!NOTE] Conclusion 
>- There are many advantages of LAN over MAN and WAN, as LAN provide excellent reliability, a high data transmission rate, and can easily be managed and shares peripheral devices too. 
>- Local Area Network cannot cover cities or towns and for that Metropolitan Area Network is needed, which can connect a city or a group of cities together.
> - Further, for connecting a Country or a group of Countries one requires a Wide Area Network.
