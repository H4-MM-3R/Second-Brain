# 2. Progress

> [!example] Progress
some kind of error in entry sections of both processes


# Secondary
# 3. Bounded Wait
![[Synchronization Mechanism-Bounded Wait|center]]
> To avoid this we bound how many times p1 can execute

# 4. No Assumptions related to hardware or speed
> Example : If certain solution only run on 32bit system but not 64-bit system
> (or)
> If it runs in 1Ghz speed but not below
