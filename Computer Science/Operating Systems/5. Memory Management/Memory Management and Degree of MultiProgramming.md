**Memory Management** -- Methods of Managing the ***Primary Memory***(RAM).

![[Memory Management and Degree of Multi-Programming-drw|800]]
> [!NOTE] Multiprogramming
> When programs are in secondary memory and bringing them to RAM
> then, dont bring only one program in the RAM.


> [!NOTE] Degree of Multiprogramming
> Bring as many as processes as possible to the RAM.
> So that CPU doesnt sit idle for if Process asks for I/O req
> CPU less idle == Utilization of CPU is high == Efficiency of CPU is High.
> 

> If " K " is the I/O operation time probability
> then CPU utilization is ( 1 - k^n ) 
> where n is degree of multiprogramming = size of RAM / size of Process
