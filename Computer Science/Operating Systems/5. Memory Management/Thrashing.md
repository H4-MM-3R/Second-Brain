Due to page fault after a certain limit increasing degree of multiprogramming leads to more time consumption known as **Thrashing**.

# Removing Thrashing
## Increasing Main Memory Space
## Long Term Scheduler
Long Term Scheduler makes sure to bring as many processes as possible 
So, decreasing its speed will hel in decresing Thrashing to an extent
