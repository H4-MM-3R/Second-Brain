### Deadlock Ignorance (Ostrich Method)
Just Ignoring the Deadlock for a trade-off between **Performance** vs **Functionalities**
### Deadlock Prevention
- mutual exclusion
- no preemption
- hold and wait
- circular wait
If any of the 4 are prevented then deadlock is prevented
### Deadlock Avoidance (Banker's Algorithm)
When we give resource to a process, we'll check if its safe or not
### Deadlock Detection and Recovery
Detect it first and recover the CPU
